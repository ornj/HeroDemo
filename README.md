# HeroDemo

This is a simple app to get you started using the UP API. This app will:
1.  Establish an OAuth connection
2.  Read the connected user's info from UP
3.  Create generic feed events in the UP app

To get started, [sign in](https://jawbone.com/up/developer/auth/login) to our [developer portal](https://jawbone.com/up/developer) (you can use your existing Jawbone UP account or create a new one).

Fill in the form to create your organization.

On your [organization page](https://jawbone.com/up/developer/account/), click Create App.

Fill in the form to create your application (for now, you can use fake URLs and edit them after deploying).

Once you have created your application, you will need to take note of your **Client Id** and **App Secret** as you will need to enter them when you deploy.

And finally, click the button below to deploy to Heroku!
